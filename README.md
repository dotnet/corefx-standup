## About

Regular online meeting (standup) with [CoreFX repo](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx) contributors.

### Goals
* Have bi-directional communication with our key contributors and valuable community members. Give them space to ask questions about anything involving our .NET Core repos, .NET Core product and .NET Framework.
* Identify blind spots and painpoints we are not aware of. Learn what we do not know (e.g. 2FA is pain when you are at school and hop computers every day, etc.).
* Give our contributors voice in the product and repo community shaping.

### Format

* Video conf call with chat
    * Likely technology: BlueJeans or Google Hangouts or Skype for Business (doesn't work on Linux)
* 1-1.5h session
* Q&A with major questions/topics submitted and voted upfront by participants/community
* Streaming live, with recording published
    * Note: 1st standup will NOT be live (we want to experiment with format/content first), but it will be recorded and published.
* Cadence: monthly
* Topics: 2-3 [topics](https://github.com/dotnet/corefx-standup/issues) selected based on voting (upvote top post)

## Future

* Cover also [CoreCLR repo](https://github.com/dotnet/coreclr)
    * Either with special contributors standup, or as part of CoreFX contributors standup.
    * Currently no ETA (we will decide after experience with 1-3 CoreFX Contributors standups).
* Live events opened to anyone from community
    * Chat (with live-questions submission) will be open to anyone – i.e. all participants can submit questions via chat.
* Time-slot (note: we have international community) – we can alternate 2 slots – morning & evening (as ASP.NET standup does)
* Bring in guests from our sub-teams to the discussion, when the prepared topics are about their specific areas.
